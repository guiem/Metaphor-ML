                    Don't expect any Shakespearean metaphors, and please bear in mind that the web might crash. Actually
                    it would be very nice if you could send me feedback as github issues

                    For a general idea on how it works you can just check the documentation in the

                    The system will be improved, there are minor and major approaches that can be taken. So far, just
                    as an explicit example of my warning on how young the project is:

                    You'll probably have noticed that under "Words as vectors" strategy there is a faster option. Well,
                    when sentences are long it can take quite a while to process them (given the lousy server I'm using)

                    This is where <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09320">approximate nearest neighbors</a> shines:
                    returning approximate results but blazingly quickly. Many times you don't need exact optimal results,
                    given we are trying to build metaphors space for ambiguity is more than welcome. Plus, no differences
                    in the retreived words were observed compared to the original exact neighbors method.
