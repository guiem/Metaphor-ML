# Metaphor

![Coverage](https://github.com/guiem/metaphor/blob/master/metaphor/static/img/coverage-badge.svg)

Artificial Intelligence system to create metaphors.

I :heart: literature & writing. I am also an Artificial Intelligence nerd. So I thought: "Y U NOT BUILT AUTOMATIC METAPHOR SYSTEM?" :trollface:

Here you'll find an attempt to build a text beautifier that's able to create new analogies. How?

* [Vector Representation of Words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec). This will be my first approach. Check the [notebooks](https://github.com/guiem/metaphor/blob/master/notebooks/word2vec_tutorial.ipynb) section to see progress.

## Installation
